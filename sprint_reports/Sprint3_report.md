|-------------|-------------------|
|Michael| <*Required*: The points and hours data are unlikely to tell the whole story about your contribution. Write a brief statement explaining and reflecting on your contribution to this milestone.> |
|Khalil| I had set goals from the get go, and worked towards them whenver I got the chance. the ending of the semester is always busy. but I was able to meet my goals. Would loved if I had more time to clean up, and download more data scene files|
|Brian| During this sprint I felt that I was effective about my tasks. I completed the tasks in a timely manner which helped prevent the disruption of progress for our team. My only flaw during this sprint was not documenting on the time tables for our report in a more effective way. |
|Asher|  |
|Eric| Although finals coming up made it tougher to manage time, I was able to complete the tasks and goals I set forth. I started working on sprint 3 much earlier than I had in previous sprint which I would attribute a lot my success to. |

#### Reflection Statements
| Team Member | Communication Reflection Statement |
|-------------|-------------------|
|Michael| |
|Khalil| Team was able to communicate their set goals. and deliver open those expectations. We were checking on each other along the way, making sure not to fall behind. Can really see the progress we made. |
|Brian| Communication was great during this sprint we have made drastic progress in our communication throughout this semester and it's a priority to keep this effectiveness in communication for our next semester. |
|Asher| |
|Eric| Communication was pretty good, we set clear goals early on during the sprint which made everything much easier. Had team meetings for the first couple weeks of the sprint but would like to see us set a dedicated time to meet every week in the future. |

### Retrospective

[Link to Recording](https://emailwsu.sharepoint.com/teams/2022.PULLM.CptS.421.423-Microsoft/Shared%20Documents/Recordings/Microsoft-20220502_023613-Meeting%20Recording.mp4?web=1)

#### What went well
  - Our time management for this sprint was something we drastically improved throughout this sprint. We set expecations for each other and held each other acccountable and when asked about the progression of the assignment we were working on it rather than putting it behind for last minute.
  - The amount of success and work that was done was really great and we kept a good stream of communication throughout these completions. This was a constant problem during the beginning of the semester and will refinements can be made we ultimately found a rhythm that will help us succeed.
  
 #### What we'd like to improve
  - We would like to keep ourselves more organized for future sprints. We know that for future sprints the amount of files and workload will increase and keeping a organized structure will help with keeping our work easy to find.
  - Another thing that we would like to improve upon is the amount of documentation that is being and the time of which it is being done. We do the work that is needed to be successful in our sprint however struggle to remember to document the amount of work. 
  - Now that we have improved in our effectiveness we would like to focus on the finer details that we can improve upon. One in particular would be to make sure to keep notes on the feedback by the professor for our sprints and avoid the small mistakes.
  
#### Changes we plan to implement in next sprint period
  - We will keep a greater emphasis on the smaller things that we can improve upon and make sure to layout a foundation that will keep us from losing our effectiveness.
  -  We also would like to keep the structure we currently have for our fall semester. Our summer break will be a challenge as this may interrupt the foundation we have built for completing our sprints. For this we hope that we can communicate and set goals that we will accomplish to keep the process we have.
  - Assessing the feedback given by the professor will be something we hope to put more emphasis on to prevent further repetition of the same mistakes being made throughout the sprints.
