|Michael| <*Required*: The points and hours data are unlikely to tell the whole story about your contribution. Write a brief statement explaining and reflecting on your contribution to this milestone.> |
|Khalil| This was the first wall that completely stopped me. Tried following documentations, and resources but, alas, to no luck. Had to change my approach and focus more on reasearching. |
|Brian| During this sprint documentation was more present and I was more proactive about it. Taking note of everything being done as well as keeping issues updated for the kanban board were done however I can improve on making sure that they have been added at an earlier time.|
|Asher| <*Required*: The points and hours data are unlikely to tell the whole story about your contribution. Write a brief statement explaining and reflecting on your contribution to this milestone.> |
|Eric| This sprint I focused more on the documentation side of things. I spent most my time working on the sprint report, video transcript, kanban board, and generic research. I could've managed my time better throughout this sprint and should work on things sooner which is something I could improve upon. |

#### Reflection Statements
| Team Member | Communication Reflection Statement |
|-------------|-------------------|
|Michael| <*Required*: The above data are unlikely to tell the whole story about your communication. Write a brief statement explaining and reflecting on your communication with your team during this milestone.> |
|Khalil| We talked about our shortcomings. and it has improved our flow of work. communication improved a bunch, and we decided to meet with our sponsor weekly instead of bi-weekly. we communicated on what part we are worrking on . and used Kanban board a lot more|
|Brian| Communication during this sprint has improved in a dramatic way. We started communicating more when finishing tasks and meeting weekly with sponsors as well. We would like to improve on making sure to have a regular team meeting during the week to ensure adequate progress.|
|Asher| <*Required*: The above data are unlikely to tell the whole story about your communication. Write a brief statement explaining and reflecting on your communication with your team during this milestone.> |
|Eric| We had much better communication during this sprint, I like how we had more frequent meetings and delegated tasks more clearly early on in the sprint. While we met more frequently I would like to see us have recurring meetings every week in future sprints. |

### Retrospective

[Link to Recording](https://emailwsu.sharepoint.com/teams/2022.PULLM.CptS.421.423-Microsoft/Shared%20Documents/Recordings/Microsoft-20220411_000845-Meeting%20Recording.mp4?web=1)

#### What went well
  - We were overall much more active and effective with our communication, we are having meeetings more often with each other and with our sponsor as well.
  - Did a much better job of delegating and documenting our tasks. We had a meeting early on in the sprint for task delegation and throughout the sprint we were much better about documenting everything in github than we were in our previous sprint.
  
 #### What we'd like to improve
  - Time management is something some of us struggled with this this sprint, we ending up working on issues closer to the deadline rather than earlier. We'd like to do our work more proactively in the future.
  - We had some problems this sprint dealing with external variables, some of us had midterms and other coursework come up this week which hurt out productivity and timeliness. We will try to have better time management in the future to avoid this.
  - Response times were a bit slow and something we look to improve. Some members had problems with Teams' notificiations which we are looking into getting resolved.
  
#### Changes we plan to implement in next sprint period
  - We would like to have recurring weekliy meetings between us 5 members. Kind of like stand-up meetings, we would like to have some time each week to go over what everyone is doing and what our progress is looking like. This will also help us with working on the project more throughout the sprint rather than more towards the end of the sprint.
  -  This sprint we meet and delegated tasks early which was great but were not as proactive with documentating the tasks that were delagated. In future sprints we will look to create all the tasks in github and document them at the start of the sprint.
  - As mentioned previously, another one of our goals going forward is to start working earlier during the sprints. In both sprint 1 and 2 we did a lot of the work later on in the sprint which caused us unnecessary stress.
