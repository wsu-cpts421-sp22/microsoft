# Astronomalies React App

## Getting Started

To get started, ensure you have NPM installed. I like to use a package manager such as [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), but you can also install it directly via the installers found on the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once these are installed, cd into the project directory and run this command to install required dependencies, such as MapBox and Reactstrap.
### `npm install --save`
<br/>

Once dependencies have been installed, you can run this command in the project directory to begin running the site locally:
### `npm start`
